# Wireless Channel Optimization Analyzer

## Overview
This tool analyzes warehouse and fulfillment center layouts to provide optimal wireless channel assignments and AP placement recommendations. It demonstrates understanding of enterprise-scale wireless network design, channel planning, and interference mitigation strategies.

## Features
- **Layout Analysis**: Calculates optimal AP placement based on facility dimensions
- **Channel Planning**: Generates non-interfering channel assignments for high-density deployments
- **Capacity Planning**: Determines AP requirements based on device types and bandwidth needs
- **Interference Detection**: Identifies common warehouse interference sources and mitigation strategies
- **5GHz & 2.4GHz Planning**: Optimizes both bands for different use cases
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed JSON reports with actionable recommendations

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated
1. **Coverage Planning**: 
   - Calculating AP coverage radius
   - Grid-based deployment patterns
   - Coverage overlap for redundancy

2. **Channel Assignment**:
   - Non-overlapping channel selection
   - Channel reuse patterns
   - Band steering strategies

3. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Device density calculations
   - Bandwidth requirement analysis
   - Per-device throughput planning

4. **Interference Mitigation**:
   - Common warehouse interference sources
   - Frequency planning around interference
   - Mitigation strategies

5. **Enterprise Features**:
   - QoS implementation
   - Roaming optimization (802.11k/v/r)
   - TX power optimization

## Usage
```bash
python3 channel_optimizer.py
```

## Example Output
The tool analyzes a warehouse scenario and provides:
- Number of APs required for coverage and capacity
- Channel assignment pattern
- Interference sources and mitigation
- Specific recommendations for deployment

## Real-World Application
This tool addresses common challenges in warehouse WiFi deployments:
- High device density (hundreds of scanners)
- Large physical spaces requiring many APs
- Metal racking causing RF challenges
- Mixed device types with different requirements
- Need for seamless roaming

## Configuration
The tool can be customized by modifying the warehouse configuration:
```python
warehouse_config = {
    "name": "Your-Facility-Name",
    "dimensions": {
        "width": 200,    # meters
        "length": 300,   # meters  
        "height": 12     # meters
    },
    "devices": {
        "total_devices": 500,
        "device_types": {
            "handheld_scanner": 200,
            "tablet": 50,
            # ... etc
        }
    }
}
```

## Report Output
